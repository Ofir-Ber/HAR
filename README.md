# Human Activity Recognition (HAR)

In this project, we elaborate on human activity recognition tracked by wearable shoe insoles that have several sensors on them. 
The project's objective is to accurately predict a range of human activities.


The methods used in the model building process are Correlation Analysis,PCA, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and finally a Catboost Classifier for multiclass classification.
